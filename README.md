--How it works/will work--
 - if you have added email it will email you everytime there is new news
 - if you have not added email it will send push notifications

--Technologies--
 - Node.js (I am most experienced in it and is faster by python but still a script language) ,express for backend (i have chosen it since it a middle ground between a library and full framework like nest which will be an overkill)
 - MongoDB (best db, easy and fast to work with)
 - Next js/ react - frontend (could probably use pure html,css,jquery) 

--Feautures to be implemented later
 - Notify users and show them all the news they have missed and not hust notufy them
